max_ens_3D
==========

Compute optimal fields for the instantaneous production of enstrophy in 3D flows.

Four parameters are needed at runtime:

1) Index for energy value
2) Initial index for enstrophy value
3) Final index for enstrophy value
4) Index corresponding to the negative 
   of the log value of viscosity

The program computes the optimal fields for enstrophy
production corresponding to the given values of Energy
and Enstrophy, for the chosen value of viscosity.

Output files and diagnostics are stored in the corresponding
folder.
